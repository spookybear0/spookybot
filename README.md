# spookybot

## Commands

The command list can be found [here](https://github.com/spookybear0/spookybot/wiki/Command-list).

Please create a GitHub issue if you have any ideas for features or commands.

## How to use

The bot is currently running on my account: `spookybear0`

Just message the bot a command (such as !help) to start.

I would really appreciate you trying this bot out so I can get a separate account for this bot. osu!support requires at least 50 active users per month to give a bot account, so please help me reach this goal

## Features

* Getting pp information from a map (through /np)
* Watching (or getting) a users recent plays
* Converting between pp and rank (seeing how much pp you need to be #rank)
* Hidden easter eggs
* Many more to come

### WIP Features

* Multiplayer lobby management
* 1v1 Matchmaking
* Map recommendations

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to spookybot (name may change in the future) you can either create a pull request or create an issue with a suggestion or bug report.

### Side note

I'm looking for a name for the bot when I eventually get a separate bot account for it. I'm open to suggestions ;).
