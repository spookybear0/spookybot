# spookybot

## Commands

The command list can be found [here](https://github.com/spookybear0/spookybot/wiki/Command-list).

Please create a GitHub issue if you have any ideas for features or commands.

## How to use

The bot is currently running on my account: `spookybear0`

Just message the bot a command (such as !help) to start.

I would really appreciate you trying this bot out so I can get a seperate account for this bot. osu!support requires at least 50 active users per month to give a bot account, so please help me reach this goal
